# TmpToml

Renders Tera templates using a toml config file as the variable source.

## Installation

### macOS

To install on macOS we provide a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) tap which provides
the `tmptoml` formula. You can use it by doing the following:

#### Add the Tap

```
brew tap "uptech/homebrew-oss"
```

#### brew install

```
brew install uptech/oss/tmptoml
```

### Build from Source
First and foremost you will need to install Rust, recommended via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install rust
```

Then build the tool:

```sh
cargo build
```

OR run the tool directly:

```sh
cargo run config.toml template.yaml qa system1
```

## TmpToml Breakdown

_**Config.toml**_

config.toml is the main configuration file for the tool. It contains the variables and values that are used to render the templates. This file contains PUBLIC values that can be checked into source control. This file contains the following sections and secondary sections:

_**Sections**_

Sections are used to define the environment and anything that is shared amongst the templates.

- qa
- production

_**Secondary Sections**_

Secondary sections are used to define the specifics for each service/system.

- system1
- system2

_**Templates**_

Each template file contains variables and values are defined in the `config.toml` file. Variables are specificed using the `{{variableName}}` syntax. If a variable exists in the templated file but not in the `config.toml`, TmpToml will throw an error and the template will not be rendered. If a variable exists in the `config.toml` file but not in the referenced templated file, TmpToml will still render the template.

_**Example:**_

First render the template:

```sh
./tmptoml config.toml template.yaml qa system1
```

The breakdown of the above command:

- `./tmptoml` is the TmpToml binary.
- `config.toml` is the path to the configuration file.
- `template.yaml` is the path to the template file.
- `qa` is the primary section/environment.
- `system1` is the name of the secondary section.

TmpToml renders the template file to STDOUT.
